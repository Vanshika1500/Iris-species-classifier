# Iris-species-classifier
An interactive web app that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on user-provided dimensions. Built using Python and Streamlit, it leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on the Iris dataset. Users can adjust sliders for sepal and petal lengths/widths, visualize their input in comparison to existing data through dynamic plots, and view real-time predictions with class probabilities.
Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib, NumPy
